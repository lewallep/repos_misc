		<h3>What you should now know</h3>
		<p>You should understand the basic structure and how to work with the basic structure of the Windows Phone using JavaScript.</p>
		<p>You should have the knowledge to go back to the Microsoft AJAX API and gather further calls to acheive more complex Map functionality.  For instance, directions, multiple pins, information from pins and so forth.</p>
		<p>You should also have the ability to work with data within the Windows Phone.  This should also provide the basis for further experimentation with these Windows Phone specific data libraries.</p>
		<h3>What to do next</h3>
		<p>Work with directions and calls to the address function.  Get geolocation points and pass them into your map functions.  Get some geolocation points and insert them into the Directions example.  These things should all be possible with a decent knowledge of JavaScript and the topics discussed in this How-To.  If not let me know, and I will revise this How-To.<p>
		<h3>A personal note</h3>
		<p>This API has been incredibly difficult to learn as there is a huge wealth of documentation but always the documentation is always for a slighty differnt goal.  It might not seem like a lot but for a person coming into this enviornment cold with so much information saying if you do it this way it will work and then it does not, it leaves one without a lot of direction to test.</p>
		<p>I have made more progress in a much shorter time once I learned how to use the iframe method to host these JavaScript techniques without all of the other baggage which comes from tutorials geared for the desktop apps.  I sincerely hope this How-To saves the people who follow a significant amount of time and frustration which could be put to use in a more productive way.</p>
