Tasks: 		 	During this time I cloned the source repository for this assignment and then sent off a message in the forums detailing the issues I am having with the supplied script for git log.

End Times:		Fri, 23 Jan 2015 03:07:53 -0800
Tasks:			Worked on the homework.  I tested to make sure my test script qunit_runner.html was working properly and got through the variables portion as best as I could.

End Times:		Fri, 23 Jan 2015 06:46:53 -0800

End Times:		Sat, 24 Jan 2015 11:31:38 -0800
Tasks:			Finish up the functions.js file.  I was only able to use the function constructor to return an object when I modified
that particular part of the code with a line containing "return this;"

End Times:		Sat, 24 Jan 2015 05:32:47 -0800
Tasks:			I worked on the objects.js and specifical the Create a constructor function for a MessageLog object.  I had very little progress. in any form.  For one I found the question to be very confusing for an introudction class where we are learning the syntax.  To have such freedom is a hinderance when frankly I would like to learn some best practices of syntax and personally my opinion is this would be an excellent place to teach it as we could use these lessons and examples later in the course when we are working on our project.

Tasks:			I worked the objects.js script and specifically the MessageLog constructor.  It was very difficult to finally understand what I needed to do and then to produce an enviornment to test it.  It was difficult because this is really the first time I have ever used JavaScript and I feel the lectures and materials could still be improved to connect some of the dots for true beginners.
