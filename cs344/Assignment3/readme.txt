This readme.txt file has a list of the file transmitted for CS344-400's homework 3 assignment.  This assignment is done by Philip Lewallen.  In this transmittal there are 5 fives.  The files are:

	smallsh.c
	myshell.c
	myshell.h
	Makefile
	readme.txt

Step 1:		Download and then unzip the files to the directory of your choice.

Step 2: 	Compile the program with the supplied Makefile.  There is only one target in the Makefile so the command is, "make" 
			without the double quotes.

Step 3:		Enter the Bash shell.

Step 4:		Run the test script in the bash shell with your test script.  The command I have been using is "testscript 2>&1", again 			without the double quotes.
